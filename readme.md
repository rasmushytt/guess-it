## Guess-It-2
### About
This is a prediction program which analyzes given numbers and calculates new values.<br>

### Usage

To test the program, download this [zip][1] file & follow the readme to install the whole thing. Once this is done, run the downloaded program and go to localhost:3000 where you can test my program. <br>

If you are having hard time installing or don't have time to do it right now, we can make a video call. I run it from my machine and show you results.
